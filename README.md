# Project Name
Bar and Grill employee todo task list

## Description
This App allows the user to add a new task with a "Task submit button" to save it to a database and be displayed in the table below. Each task that is added to the database gets displayed on the table with a "Finished" button and a "Delete" button. The "Finished" button allows the user to mark a task as Finished in the database and change the background color of that task to green. The "Delete" button allows the user to delete the task and remove it from the database and table on the web page.
